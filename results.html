									<h2>I. Compliance</h2>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Almost all elementary schools in both the RPS and non-RPS groups were found compliant with the policy; only one elementary school in the sample (n = 15) was not coded as compliant.  The principal at the one non-compliant elementary school, however, indicated that products may be available in the school nurse’s office or the Vice Principal’s office.  Therefore, it is possible that this elementary school is actually also compliant—however, for the purposes of this project, “I don’t know” responses were assumed to be negative.
										</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">In any case, a 95% confidence interval (CI) with a finite population correction (FPC) for the compliance rate among RPS elementary schools is [0.8518484,  1.014818].  Parameters used were: p-hat = 14/15 = 93.333%, n = 15, N = 25.  From this, we can say with 95% confidence that 85–100% of the 25 total RPS elementary schools are complying with 2020 SB 232/HB 405 and providing period products in “accessible locations.”  Our confidence level may be smaller than this, given that our sample is not perfectly random (only responding schools are included, and 10 schools declined to respond).  Population sizes are obtained from the <a href=https://www.doe.virginia.gov/data-policy-funding/data-reports/statistics-reports/enrollment-demographics>2023–24 VDOE Local and Regional Schools and Centers report</a>.</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Among non-RPS elementary schools (p-hat = 1.000, n = 5, N = 1126), the 95% confidence interval for compliance rates comes out to [1, 1] because all five in our sample were compliant.  This is not adjusted for a finite population because our sample size is less than 5% of the population of VA elementary schools.  We should keep in mind that our sample is nowhere near the recommended sample size for representativeness (which would be at least 100 schools, given that there are 1126 non-RPS public elementary schools in VA).  As such, it is possible that the actual percentage of compliant non-RPS ES is substantially lower.  Given that almost all elementary schools in the RPS sample were also compliant, however, it is likely that <b>compliance among elementary schools in VA is generally high</b>—and that at almost all VA ES, MHPs are available to students in at least one accessible location in schools.
										</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">For all RPS and non-RPS elementary schools other than the one that did not provide products to students, these “accessible locations” consisted of or included school nurse’s offices, with some schools also indicating that they provided products in their restrooms, counseling offices, teacher drawers, and main offices.  In fact, almost all schools, regardless of level—26/30 schools out of the total sample, or 86.667%—indicated providing MHPs in their school nurse’s offices.  The school nurse’s office, thus, is the most common location in schools where products are accessible to students, according to this survey.  This suggests that <b>school nurse’s offices are a critical access point for MHPs for students, and that efforts to increase awareness among students about the availability of these products might center around school nurse’s offices</b>.
										</p>
										<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/rps es compliance fpc r screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of R code displaying results for RPS ES compliance rat 95% confidence interval" /></span> 
										<p><i>95% Confidence Interval for RPS ES Compliance with FPC: [0.8518484, 1.014818]</i></p> -->
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">It does not make much sense to construct a CI for compliance among RPS middle schools, as we only have data for two schools out of seven, and the compliance rate is 50%—the resulting CI is too broad.  While we cannot assume the RPS MS compliance rate to be 50% based on one compliant school and one non-compliant school, looking to the MS responses more broadly, we can tentatively conclude that <b>compliance is far less prevalent at the MS level than at the ES level</b>.</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">A non-FPC CI for middle schools (including both RPS and non-RPS schools) is [-0.04386884, 0.7105355], with the actual compliance rate in our sample being 40%.  From this, we can conclude—making the bold assumption that our sample of five schools is representative enough of the overall population of public middle schools in VA, despite our very small sample size—that no more than about 71% of middle schools are complying with the policy.
										</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">The validity of this estimation relies very heavily on the representativeness of this sample, which, due to its small size and possible self-selection bias, cannot be very high.  It is possible that schools experiencing issues with compliance were more likely to respond to the survey due to a greater concern about the policy, for example—or the opposite, that principals at schools that were compliant with the policy were more likely to respond to the survey.
										</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Whether one or the other is true will greatly affect the interpretation of the results, but this cannot be said from the information available.  Also, the way in which RPS schools were surveyed was different from the way in which non-RPS schools were surveyed, which further impairs the validity of this sample.  The best we can say, in any case, is that we are fairly certain that VA public middle schools are less compliant than VA public elementary schools, with this policy—as the lower bounds of the RPS & non-RPS ES CIs are higher than the upper bound of the overall MS CI.
										</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Among RPS high schools (p-hat = 0.667, n = 3, N = 8), a 95% FPC CI is [0.2158238,  1.117509].  Among non-RPS HS (p-hat = 0.667, n = 3), a 95% CI is [0.1332222, 1.200111].  The compliance rate is the same for both the RPS and non-RPS sample, at ⅔ schools, or 67%.
										</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Because the confidence intervals overlap, <b>we cannot say for sure whether the compliance rate for public middle schools in the total population is lower than the compliance rate for public high schools</b>.  However, according to our sample alone, <b>we can guess that the compliance rate is slightly lower at middle schools than at high schools—this is supported by the reasons for non-compliance</b>.</p>

									<h2>II. Obstacles to Implementation</h2>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Vandalism was the factor most correlated with non-compliance (i.e., compliance = 0).  Only one school out of the eight non-complying schools at the MS/HS level said vandalism was not an obstacle to providing period products in bathrooms.  Elementary school administrators were not surveyed about obstacles to providing period products in bathrooms, as this is not a requirement at the ES level.</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Only one MS/HS respondent listed budget limitations as an obstacle to implementation, which was interesting because this was initially presumed to be the major cause of non-implementation.  3/15 MS/HS in the sample (20%) listed a lack of custodial staff awareness as an obstacle to implementation.  2/15 MS/HS (13%) cited a lack of dispensers as an obstacle, and 2/15 (13%) cited restrictive restroom policies.
										</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">As mentioned earlier, however, at all but one non-compliant school where factors other than vandalism were cited as obstacles to providing period products in bathrooms, vandalism co-existed as an issue.  This suggests that, while schools may face other obstacles to providing MHPs in restrooms, vandalism prevention should be the primary concern when providing recommendations to help schools make MHPs more accessible to students in restrooms.
										</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">When asked about any other obstacles to implementation (free-response), 3/4 four schools that chose to respond emphasized that, “When placed in all restrooms, vandalism and waste ensued,” that there was “...destruction of machines the first year placed in bathrooms,” and that, at one school, a TikTok trend had resulted in bathrooms being vandalized and an administrative decision to relocate MHPs to other accessible locations.
										</p>

									<hr />

									<h2>III. Funding</h2>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">While surprising that budget constraints were not a major cause of non-compliance, this may be because schools are finding alternative ways to obtain products.</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">17/25 schools (68%) that replied other than “I don’t know” or “Our school does not provide period products to students” to the question, “How does your school fund the purchase of period products?  Please check all that apply,” listed “School budget” as one of their means of acquiring MHPs.  This means 38% of schools (at least in this overall sample) relied entirely on personal/staff money, donations, and/or nonprofit organizations to source period products for students (one school listed “Other” and none of these).
										</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Once again, we cannot conclude that this is representative of the total population of VA schools—particularly because of the overrepresentation of Richmond Public Schools—but the data does indicate that a substantial portion of schools are relying on alternative, non-budgetary means to obtain products.
										</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Among RPS schools, the following sources of MHPs were used: school budget (6/11), personal/staff money (2/11), donations (4/11), nonprofit organizations (2/11), and “other” (1/11).  At two RPS schools, personal/staff money and donations were used to supplement the school budget allocation for MHPs.  Personal/staff money was only used at the MS/HS level in RPS.  Three RPS schools relied entirely on donations and/or nonprofit organizations to source MHPs.
										</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Among non-RPS schools, the following sources of MHPs were used: school budget (11/15), personal/staff money (2/15), donations (8/15), and nonprofit organizations (6/15).  Of the 15 non-RPS schools in the sample, two relied entirely on donations and/on nonprofit organizations to provide MHPs to students.  This is about 13% of our sample.  Our sample is small, so we cannot necessarily generalize this to the entire population—a 95% CI is [-0.03869733,  0.305364]—but if this is truly representative of the population, it may indicate some issues.
										</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">A high reliance on nonprofit organizations and donations may overburden nonprofits and/or mean that schools can only restock products at irregular intervals.  If the latter is the case, students may not have access to MHPs as much as they should.  An interview with a CIS representative at a Chesterfield county high school revealed that MHPs “tend to go out of stock”—maybe because of this.  Once again, personal/staff money was only used at the MS/HS level among non-RPS schools.
										</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Four schools in the total sample used 3 sources of funding, nine used 2 sources, and thirteen used 1 source.  In other words, half of the sample of schools is using more than one source of funding.  Only funding sources explicitly listed were counted; some schools listed “I don’t know” among other funding sources, which may mean they have more sources of obtaining products than listed.
										</p>

									<hr />

									<h2>IV. Vandalism</h2>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Vandalism (based on responses that vandalism was an “obstacle to implementation” or “may be an obstacle/not sure”) was more prevalent at middle schools, schools with larger student bodies, schools with lower chronic absenteeism rates, and non-RPS schools in the sample.
										</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">School size seems to have no effect on whether or not vandalism is an issue.  This was tested for significance via a multivariate regression analysis using Excel.
										</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">7/10 responding RPS MS/HS listed vandalism as an issue.  This may indicate that vandalism is prevalent as an issue in VA MS/HS; however, we can also ascribe this, at least partially, to selection bias.  It is possible that school administrators unable to implement this policy due to vandalism were more likely to respond to the survey and care about this policy.
										</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Vandalism was also more frequent, as an issue, at the MS than the HS level.  This relationship was significant at 0.05 level.
										</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Of the schools that listed vandalism as an obstacle, a slight majority were non-Title I schools (5/8).  Multivariate regression analysis did not find school Title I status to be a significant predictor of vandalism; however, this could be due to a too-small sample.  Of all responding non-RPS MS/HS, only 3 qualified for Title I, and 2 of these 3 listed vandalism as an obstacle.  This means only one Title I school in the non-RPS sample did not face issues with vandalism that impacted their ability to implement 2020 SB232/HB405.  Also, of the 8 schools that listed vandalism as an obstacle, all 3 of the Title I schools had no compliance (i.e., products were not provided in restrooms).  Other schools were still compliant, despite the challenge.
										</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Further analysis is needed to definitively say whether school socioeconomic status is correlated with vandalism.
										</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">The sample was too small to draw any conclusions based on district party affiliation.
										</p>

									<hr />

									<h2>V. Chronic absenteeism</h2>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Chronic absenteeism rates between the 2018–19 and 2022–23 school years increased at all but two schools in the sample for which this data was available (n = 27), with an average increase of 8.23%.  This is likely due to lasting effects of the pandemic and virtual education.  Even if clear that implementation of 2020 SB 232/HB 405 alone was not enough to decrease chronic absenteeism rates, I wanted to test whether schools that complied with the policy had a smaller increase in chronic absenteeism over this period than schools that did not comply with the policy.  Here are the results of a one-tailed, two-sample t-test conducted in R to see if schools that complied (comp1) had a smaller increase in absenteeism rates, on average, than schools that did not comply with the policy (comp0).</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">The results show that, at an alpha level of 0.05, there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.  In other words, the data in our sample does not support the alternative hypothesis that schools that implemented 2020 SB232/HB405 saw smaller increases in chronic absenteeism rates between 2018–19 and 2022–23 than non-implementing schools.</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">This is far from a perfect analysis, for many reasons.  For one, two school years’ worth of data before and after the policy’s passage is insufficient for a true time-series comparison.  A further analysis could be conducted using more years’ worth of data, but this would not make much sense given the overwhelming impacts/threat of history of the pandemic and virtual education, as well as other policies passed during this time frame.  We would need a lot more data to control for these factors, and maybe even data from other states, before drawing any conclusions about the impact of free MHP provision in schools on chronic absenteeism.  Given, however, that absenteeism has increased across all schools—regardless of compliance status—we can say that if this policy has any effect on chronic absenteeism, said effect is very minimal.</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">A better way to assess this would be to survey students to test whether students quantitatively felt like the policy benefited them.  Research could also look at the attendance records of female students, specifically, to triangulate these surveys.  Chronic absenteeism data collected by the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) is not broken down by sex.</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Another major issue in the methods is that this study does not account for which schools were already complying with the policy before 2018–19… it is possible that, for example, many schools provided products in school nurses’ offices prior to the mandate’s passage… which would make high compliance at the ES level (where providing MHPs in restrooms is not required) almost self-evident and not due to some special characteristic of elementary schools that make them more likely to comply with the policy.</p>
									
									<hr />

									<h2>VI. Administrator Awareness</h2>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Exactly 2/3 of respondents (20/30 = 66.7%) were unaware of the policy before completing the survey.</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Administrator awareness was not a significant correlate to compliance at an alpha level of 0.05 (tested via multivariate regression), but of the schools where survey respondents were previously aware of the policy’s existence, only two (2/10 = 20%) were non-compliant.  Of the schools where survey respondents were not previously aware of the policy, seven (7/20 = 35%) were non-compliant.
										</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">A multiple regression analysis revealed that administrator awareness is not predicted at the 0.05 level by Title I vs. non-Title I status, school level, whether the principal is female or not, school size, or district political leaning.  A separate regression also revealed that administrator awareness is not predictive of compliance.</p>

									<hr />

									<h2>VII. Administrator Attitudes</h2>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">5/30 administrators (17%), when asked whether they would rather use the funding used to provide MHPs to students for other purposes, answered yes.  Alternative funding uses specified included:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Basic School Supplies,</li>
											<li>Snacks for identified students to take home, and</li>
											<li>A hygiene cabinet (period products, deodorant, lotion, chapstick available to female and male students).</li>
										</ul>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">One principal who answered yes clarified: “I would prefer to fund other initiatives, but I need to ensure that this need is met.”
										</p>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">This suggests that, generally, VA school principals are accepting of the mandate’s provisions and view providing free MHPs to students in school as a meaningful use of school funding.</p>

									<hr />

									<h2>VIII. Qualitative results: CIS interviews</h2>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Three representatives of Communities in Schools (CIS) were interviewed for the project, one at a high school, and two at elementary schools.  All three representatives were from Chesterfield County Public Schools (CCPS).  Main takeaways from the interviews were that:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Alongside administrators, CIS representatives are also often unaware of this policy.</li>
											<li>Nonprofits like Sylvia’s Sisters are very helpful for schools to provide period products, and nonprofit partnerships ensure that schools are able to comply with the mandate and also restock products on a regular basis.  One CIS administrator mentioned that Sylvia’s Sisters’s product kits allowed for a wider variety of products to be provided, to serve students’ needs better.</li>
										</ul>
										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">When asked about the common oppositions to mandated MHP provision in schools, that it introduces an extra regulatory concern for schools and that it puts more financial pressure on schools already low on resources, the CIS representatives answered as follows:
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li>“I think that we have to be able to provide things like that… A lot of our kids are under the poverty level and can't afford… [MHPs] because food stamps don't buy tampons.”</li>
											<li>“I don't feel like that is an extra burden because it's not something that we have to do all day every day. It's not like we're running around saying, <em>Hey, do you need a pad?  Hey, do you need a pad?”</em></li>
											<li>“It's something that makes a person feel human… That's a necessity.”</li>
											<li>“If a child is coming to us on their period and we have nothing, then they're worried about it all day, or they have to go home. So it affects attendance, you know… it affects their grade… If we want them to be in school and be able to concentrate and things like that, it's the same to me as providing them lunch, you know, there is a necessary product that we’ve got to have…”</li>
											<li>“RPS has a terrible attendance rate… let's do whatever we can to keep them in the building.”</li>
											<li>“I think those oppositions come from people who have never worked in a school.  Honestly.”</li>
											<li>“...What Sylvia’s Sisters does is taking the stigma off of… being a woman… it definitely helps us support girls in ways that, if we didn't have it, it would just be really, really hard for them to navigate through the building and school and things like that, just through sheer embarrassment.  I mean, it's a natural thing… you can't stop it.”</li>
											<li>“It's just natural, and if we can provide things to help keep them, you know, mentally happy—and, you know, it's hard enough, but mentally happy in the building—that's what we need to be doing.”</li>
										</ul>

									<hr />

									<h2>IX. Discussion</h2>

										<p style="text-indent: 50px;">This is primarily an exploratory study, and sample sizes are too small to draw any definitive conclusions.  However, there are some findings worth noting—that almost all elementary schools are complying with VA’s 2020 SB232/HB405, that vandalism is the primary cause of non-compliance, that school level was the main correlate to compliance (with middle schools having the most compliance issues, likely due to the higher prevalence of vandalism at that level), that most school principals are not aware of the policy’s existence, and that most administrators do not object to the mandate’s requirements.  From the qualitative component of the survey, we find that nonprofits play a crucial role in helping schools provide MHPs to students, but that this can be draining on nonprofits.  Generally, there is a lack of awareness about this policy at the administrative level, and even among organizations providing services in low-income schools.
