								<p style="text-indent: 50px;">In April 2020, the Commonwealth of Virginia passed SB 232/HB 405, an unfunded mandate that:</p>
								<blockquote>“Requires each school board to make tampons or pads available, at all times and at no cost to students, (i) in such accessible locations as it deems appropriate in each elementary school in the local school division and (ii) in the bathrooms of each middle school and high school in the local school division” (SB 232 Menstrual supplies; school boards shall make available in each school building, 2020).</blockquote>
								<p style="text-indent: 50px;">This bill had been several years in the works, with interest groups in Virginia and across the United States pushing for “menstrual equity” in schools for years prior.  Menstrual equity, as coined by advocate Jennifer Weiss-Wolf in 2015, describes “laws and policies that ensure that menstrual products are safe and available for those who need them” (Weiss-Wolf, 2017).</p>
								<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Despite interest group pressure, upon passing 2020 SB 232/HB 405, Virginia became only the fifth US state to require middle/high schools to provide menstrual hygiene products (MHPs) in restrooms for free—with California having been the first state to do so, in 2017, and New York City, the first locality, in 2016 (Alliance for Period Supplies, 2024).</p>
								<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Research on the impacts of such provision demonstrate that, at least among high school students, a school’s failure to provide MHPs can lead to students missing school, being late to school, or leaving school early—it can even hinder students’ self-reported ability to learn (Cotropia, 2019).  One 2021 study surveying female students at a public St. Louis, Missouri high school found that 33.6% of students surveyed had missed school at least once in the past year due to not having an adequate supply of period products, and that 12.4% had missed school “more than one day each month” due to a lack of access to MHPs (Sebert, et. al, 2022).  Of the 119 students surveyed, 66.9% indicated getting products from a school source, such as an in-school health clinic, the nurse’s office, or a teacher/staff member—suggesting the critical positioning of schools as an access point for these resources.  It should be noted that the student population of the Missouri school chosen for this study was 99% eligible for free or reduced lunch.  As of 2024, 11 Virginia school divisions, and 86 individual schools, fall under the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), which “allows the nation’s highest poverty schools and districts to serve breakfast and lunch at no cost to all enrolled students” (Virginia Department of Education, 2024; Virginia Hunger Solutions, 2024).  This may suggest transferability of findings and similar challenges faced among students in comparably economically disadvantaged areas in Virginia.</p>
								<p style="text-indent: 50px;">While there is notably more scholarship on the importance of schools providing free MHPs in general than there is about the positive impact of schools specifically providing these products in restrooms, one study found a few advantages to distribution in school bathrooms: </p>
								<blockquote>“(1) it removed the need for students to ask teachers or staff (gatekeepers) for a product and (2) it reduced missed class time from seeking out a product… Removing school distribution gatekeepers was critical as it gave students more agency and discretion; they would not be seen asking for a product or walking back to the bathroom with it” (Schmitt, 2021).</blockquote>
								<p style="text-indent: 50px;">VA’s 2020 SB 232/HB 405 has great potential, in this light—but it lacks clear oversight mechanisms.  Additionally, since its passage, no structured analysis has assessed the status or scope of its implementation, and the Richmond-based nonprofit Sylvia’s Sisters, which supplies multiple VA schools with menstrual products to support their compliance with this policy, has anecdotally observed that many schools struggle with compliance.  During a preliminary interview, Sylvia’s Sisters’s president, Ms. Brittany Averette, identified the Richmond City Public Schools (RPS) system as of particular concern for non-implementation.</p>
								<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Deciphering exactly why Virginia schools, and particularly Richmond schools, struggle to implement this policy is important: this could flag schools at high risk for non-implementation and identify follow-up measures to help them overcome challenges.  The reasoning behind compliance or non-compliance could also have implications for the provisions of current legislation at the local and national level.</p>
								<p style="text-indent: 50px;">In Virginia, Delegate Holly Seibold (D-Fairfax) has advocated for giving school divisions annual grants of $250,000 to purchase menstrual products.  Her proposal did not progress to the 2024 General Assembly session; however, if this study finds that implementation levels of 2020 SB 232/HB 405 are low enough in Virginia schools, and that budgetary constraints/school socioeconomic status (SES) are major factors correlated with non-compliance and/or cited causally, it may support this bill’s passage (Virginia’s Legislative Information System, 2024).  At the national level, U.S. H. R. 3646, or the “Menstrual Equity For All Act of 2023,” introduced in May 2023 and subsequently referred to the Subcommittee on Health, would allow states to use “federal grant funds to provide students in elementary and secondary schools with free menstrual products.”  Again, if budgetary constraints are found to be a major hindrance to implementation of VA’s bill, this study could provide important support for the passage of the Menstrual Equity For All Act, as well—given that, proceeding from the results, additional funding would have evidence-based potential to turn the tide on implementation.</p>
