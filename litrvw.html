								<h2>School Menstrual Equity Policy Implementation in the Literature</h2>
									<p style="text-indent: 50px;">The literature on implementation of school menstrual equity policy is sparse, in part because this category of legislation is so new.  However, there is an existing body of research about factors affecting the implementation of unfunded mandates in schools, more broadly, and findings from these studies may translate to this application.</p>
									<p style="text-indent: 50px;">One case study very relevant to this project observed not only the implementation of a school menstrual equity policy, but also the process of its passage, in New York City (NYC) public schools—seeking to explain both the factors that led to the bill’s passage and the challenges schools faced in implementing it.  The New York City bill in question is very similar in its provisions to VA 2020 SB 232/HB 405.  The bill’s summary states that it:</p>
									<blockquote>“...[requires] the Department of Education (DOE) to make feminine hygiene products available at no cost to students in the bathrooms of school buildings located in facilities that are leased by the DOE or over which DOE has care, custody, and control, serving female students in grades six through twelve” (The New York City Council, 2016).</blockquote>
									<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Through a desk review, field observation, and qualitative interviews with purposively sampled stakeholders from three broad groups—Government and Advocacy, Education (administrative, health & logistics/operations), and Other (private sector, parents)—the study found that a number of schools had chosen not to shift their distribution of menstrual products to restrooms.  The specific degree of implementation was not quantified, but reasons for noncompliance given ranged from “operational challenges,” such as younger students sticking menstrual pads to toilet stall doors, to administrators not wanting students to be unable to access MHPs due to pre-existing restrictions on restroom use stemming from concerns about vaping, substance use, and other misbehavior.  Similar instances of pads being stuck to bathroom stall walls were noted in VA public schools when products were provided in restrooms (Averette, 2024).</p>
									<p style="text-indent: 50px;">The NYC study also noted that some school administrators and staff reported “little to no knowledge of the policy's existence,” despite email correspondences having been sent to relevant actors after its passage.  This suggests that routine reminders and information sharing—at least providing more than one round/format of communication—may be important, to ensure that implementation is not hindered due to a lack of information from missed communications.  Policy awareness is an important factor to assess in Virginia, as well; similar recommendations could apply.  The NYC study also suggested that the NYC DOE’s Health Education unit create educational flyers to accompany product dispensers in restrooms that provide information about proper use and disposal.  This was indicated by Sylvia’s Sisters as a project they are already looking to execute in partnership with schools (Averette, 2024).</p>
									<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Despite the evident similarity between the content and intentions, and even outcomes, of the VA and NYC bills, there are a few relevant distinctions between the two.  For one, VA’s bill applies at the statewide level.  Evidence indicates that statewide mandates can lead to lower compliance than local mandates in a number of ways.  They may create confusion about who is accountable for various implementation stages, due to there being more layers of government—and more agencies and actors—involved than with local policy.  Statewide policies may also ignore differential local manifestations of a common policy problem and require implementation in a way that may not be efficient or effective in all localities—for example, some schools may have restrictive restroom usage policies that would actually hinder students’ ability to access MHPs, if provided in restrooms.  State mandates may also impose costs on local governments that the latter may not have the capacity to accommodate, which local governments can factor in more effectively, given budgetary figures specific to their own localities (Grossback, 2002).  This indicates that budgetary constraints may be more of a blockage to implementation in the case of the Virginia bill.</p>
									<p style="text-indent: 50px;">A second difference between the VA and NYC bills is that the NYC bill clearly delegates implementation responsibility to the city’s Department of Education (NYC DOE), within the bill’s text itself.  The VA bill does not explicitly delegate implementation responsibility to any state or local agency—this may predict lower levels of implementation in Virginia than in NYC.  In 2021, after the investigative work for the NYC study in question had already been completed, the NYC Commission on Gender Equity also established a Menstrual Equity Workgroup to oversee implementation; no such committee or task force exists in Virginia (Weniger, 2023).  This suggests a greater degree of structure in delegating elements of implementation in NYC that does not exist within the framework of Virginia’s policy.</p>
									<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Another contrast between the NYC and VA policies is that, in NYC, the DOE provides products to schools, beyond the ones already being supplied.  In VA, schools are expected to make room to provide MHPs within their existing budgets.  This may further indicate that funding is a greater barrier to implementation in VA than in NYC.  Finally, the VA mandate was passed in 2020—a year when, according to a December 2023 interview with VA Senator Jennifer Boysko, legislative compliance was not a particular priority (Rowan, 2024).  This deprioritization of implementation at passage could have carry-forward effects into the present.</p>
								<h2>General School Policy Implementation in the Literature								</h2>
									<p style="text-indent: 50px;">With other statewide mandates, more economically disadvantaged schools have been found to comply at lower rates (Anderson and McKenzie, 2022).  A 2022 study that used school administrative data and surveys of school principals and counselors to evaluate the implementation of a statewide policy limiting out-of-school suspensions and expulsions in Arkansas elementary schools found that relatively disadvantaged schools were more likely to not comply with this policy, which was ironically intended to make school disciplinary action more equitable.  The article additionally cited the following reasons for non-compliance: a lack of staff or physical space, a lack of awareness of how to implement the policy or the “impracticality” of compliance, “local preferences and needs,” and school leaders’ attitudes towards the policy.  Many of these have the potential to overlap with implementation challenges of VA’s 2020 SB 232/HB 405.</p>
									<p style="text-indent: 50px;">The Arkansas study triangulates its results by not only interviewing relevant actors but also confirming findings with actual administrative data that may suggest the degree of policy implementation.  While its authors determine that “principal perspectives are particularly important” in influencing compliance, it should be noted that principals are not as direct an actor in the implementation of menstrual equity policy as they are in implementing disciplinary policy (Schmitt, 2021).  The Arkansas study also lists broader policy characteristics that predict successful policy implementation as follows: clarity of policy, as opposed to ambiguity; an awareness of implementing actors’ resources and capacity; and practitioner attitudes.  In studying implementation of 2020 SB 232/HB 405, practitioner attitudes will be addressed via the proxies of school principals’ awareness of the policy and the political leaning of a school’s congressional district.</p>
									<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Another study, evaluating school-by-school implementation of district-level school wellness policies in 151 Connecticut school districts, found, among other correlations, that schools in majority-Republican districts tended to score significantly lower on compliance than schools in majority-Democratic districts, as determined by the ratio of registered voters for each party (Schwartz, et. al, 2012).  Schools in districts with a relatively even balance of registered Republicans and Democrats (i.e., 0.8–1.2 Democrats per Republican) had compliance scores, on average, in between those of majority-Republican and majority-Democratic districts’ schools.</p>
									<p style="text-indent: 50px;">The study gathered data by surveying school principals and collecting district demographic data from public sources.  Sociodemographic data collected about schools included: “percentage of the population living below the poverty line; percentage of white students; median family income; total district enrolment; total district expenditure per pupil; percentage of town budget devoted to education; population density; percentage of students passing the Connecticut Mastery Test… number of food stores and restaurants in the district; and ratio of registered Democrats to Republicans.”  The number of food stores and restaurants in a district is not a relevant variable to measure when evaluating 2020 SB 232/HB 405’s implementation, but the remainder of the variables may provide valuable insight.</p>
									<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Whether a school is an elementary, middle, or high school may also be relevant—this study found that middle schools tended to comply with more school wellness policies than high schools.  This will also be measured as an independent variable when studying 2020 SB 232/HB 405’s implementation in VA.  District population density was also found to be significantly negatively correlated with policy implementation at the school level.  In terms of barriers to implementation, which were measured as a secondary category of independent variables, “lack of coordination” and “lack of resources” had the most significant negative correlation with implementation strength; “lack of training” was also listed as a detracting factor from implementation.  The five possible barriers to implementation that could have been listed were: lack of support, lack of coordination, lack of resources, sales of unhealthy food, and lack of training.  To quantify implementation, this study coded each survey item (listing various district-level wellness policies) on a scale from 0–2, asking principals to note whether each policy was “fully in place” (2), “partially in place” or “under development” (1), or “not in place”/“don't know” (0).  The percentage of survey items that obtained a 2 determined a school’s “practices strength,” or degree of policy compliance.</p>
									<p style="text-indent: 50px;">While conducted in a different state, on a different type of policy—and looking at policy implementation more broadly, as opposed to implementation of a single policy—this study has a number of implications for designing a procedure to evaluate compliance of 2020 SB 232/HB 405 in Virginia.  It pinpoints some relevant variables to assess at the district level—i.e., population density, political climate, and socioeconomic status—that may contribute towards lower or higher compliance.  The VA study will help supplement its findings, to understand whether lack of coordination/resources are, in fact, the primary barriers to compliance for schools when it comes to implementing wellness-related policies—as well as whether population density, political climate, and socioeconomic status are potentially correlated with implementation of school menstrual equity policy, specifically.</p>
									<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Another study assessing the effect of school board members’, district administrators’, principals’, and teachers’ attitudes towards a policy on its implementation found that “the beliefs and values of the implementers—particularly whether they perceive a need for the policy or a compatibility between the assumptions of the policy concerning the implementation environment and their assumptions—are important in policy implementation” (LaRocque, 1986).  This suggests that looking at at least school administrators’ attitudes towards SB 232/HB 405 in Virginia could be relevant.  School principals were identified in this study as critical mediators between school board members and school faculty/staff who may be responsible for policy implementation, in terms of distributing information and delegating responsibility for components of compliance.  As such, principals will be assessed on their attitudes towards SB 232/HB 405, based on responses to the following question: “If your school could use the funding it currently uses to provide free period products in bathrooms to fund another program/initiative to support students, would you rather it do that?  If so, what initiative(s) would you rather fund?”  This study primarily relied on formal and informal interviews with school board members, district administrators, principals, and teachers; the forthcoming study will include both semistructured interviews and email surveys, for the sake of standardizing principal replies.									</p>
									<p style="text-indent: 50px;">One meta-analysis of program implementation across preventative programs implemented in schools suggested eight steps to improve implementation:</p>
									<blockquote>“(1) specify the essential ingredients of an intervention; (2) collaborate with change agents in field settings to tailor the program to the target setting; (3) obtain a clear commitment to administer the agreed-upon intervention; (4) train change agents to conduct the program effectively; (5) provide on-going supervision and consultation once the program has begun; (6) be ready for unexpected problems; (7) do pilot work; and (8) designate staff with responsibilities for implementation.”</blockquote>
									<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Of these, designating staff with responsibilities for implementation, specifying the essential components of implementation (i.e., MHPs being made available in relevant locations AND being regularly restocked), and tailoring the program to the target setting (i.e., finding other accessible locations for students to access products) could be relevant to this study (Durlak, 1998).</p>
